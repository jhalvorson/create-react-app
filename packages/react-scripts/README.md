# Signal React Scripts

To be used to kickoff React **web** projects, both internal and for clients.

### Setup 

1. install`create-react-app` globally on your machine 
2. run `create-react-app --scripts-version signal-react-scripts`, you must be using the local NPM registry and if out of the studio you must be over the VPN.

### Development

The current version of `signal-react-scripts` uses SCSS, in the future we'll be introducing our React component library and we will then most likelt switch to using Styled Components. Until then use the current SCSS setup.

### Test setup

We currently use Enzyme and Jest for writing all React tests.

### Writing Tests

Please refer to Confluence for information on writing tests for React.
