### Setup 

1. install`create-react-app` globally on your machine 
2. run `create-react-app --scripts-version voyager-scripts`

### Why?

Saves time for bootstrapping projects. Comes pre-loaded with SCSS support, React Router, linting, Enzyme and Jest etc.

### TODO:

- [x] Implement SCSS
- [x] Add React Router
- [x] Linting
- [x] Implement testing
- [ ] Build the base components
- [ ] Build the base layouts
- [ ] Build base views
